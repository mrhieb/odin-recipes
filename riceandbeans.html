    <h1>Rice and Beans</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to make beans and rice.  I usually change my recipe depending upon what leftover I have.</p>
    <p>Feel free to modify the ingredients as you see fit</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>Beans</ul>
        <ul>Rice</ul>
        <ul>Garlic</ul>
        <ul>Onions</ul>
        <ul>Diced tomatoes and chilis(can)</ul>
        <ul>Spices: Chili powder, Oregano, Cumin, Salt</ul>
        <h3>Prep:</h3>
        Use a garlic press to dice 2-3 large galic cloves.  Dice an onion.  Rinse beans if bought in a can.
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        I heat up about 3 Tablespoons of Olive oil and add the garlic and onion.  I stir this for about 3-5 minutes.  Then, I add the black beans and the can of chili beans(without staining).  Then, I add Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis. Cook until the beans become more tender.  Add Salt, Chili powder, Oregano, and cumin to taste.  I just throw a decent amount of salt(1 teaspoon), but ¼ teaspoon of oregano and cumin.  I don’t add chili powder if I get chili beans.  However, I add it if I use 2 cans of black beans.
